# RMS (root-mean-square)

The RMS is also known as the quadratic mean and is a measure for the average energy of a signal.
RMS is widely used for AE / structure-borne sound analysis, e.g. for wear detection or leakage detection.

$$
{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{x[i] ^ 2}}
$$

## Applications

- Leakage detection (for example in valves)
- Wear detection

# Crest factor

The crest factor is defined as the ratio of the peak amplitude to the RMS of a signal.
It can be intepreted as a measure for the impulsiveness of a signal.

$$
{CrestFactor} = \frac{\max |x|}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{x[i] ^ 2}}}
$$

## Applications

- Fault detection in bearings and gear boxes
